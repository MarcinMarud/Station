Data Pipeline Project for Gas Station
Project Description

This project generates synthetic data for a gas station and processes it through a full ETL pipeline. I use Python to manage and control the database, including creating views and other database structures.

Then, I analyze the data using PostgreSQL queries to extract useful business insights. Finally, I build a dashboard in Power BI to visualize key metrics and trends.

Data Generation & Pipeline
Data generation was done by the faker library in Python. File main.py controls evrything from generation to refreshing dashboard
